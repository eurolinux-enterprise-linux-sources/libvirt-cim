  Patches should be submitted using Mercurial's patchbomb extension,  and we 
  recommend using the queues extension as well.  On top of that, we have some 
  guidelines you should follow when submitting patches.  This makes reviewing 
  patches easier, which in turns improves the chances of your patch being 
  accepted in a timely fashion.
</p><p>
  For help on how to use the patchbomb extension, see 
  <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch14.html">Section 14.4</a> of <i>
  Distributed revision control with Mercurial</i>.
</p><p>
  For help on the queues extension, see 
  <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch12.html">Chapter 12</a>.
</p><h4>Single Patches:</h4><ol><li>
  <p>
    When you add a patch to the queue you have an idea of where you're going with 
    it, and the commit message should reflect that.  Be specific.  Avoid  just 
    saying something like, "Various fixes to AllocationCapabilities."  Add a list 
    of what was actually fixed, like, "Add EnumInstanceNames support," and, 
    "Eliminate duplicate instances."
</p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    The first line of your commit message will be the subject of the patch email 
    when you send it out, so write it like a subject.  Keep it short and to the 
    point, then start a new line and feel free to be as verbose as you need to 
    be.  The entire commit message will be included in the patch.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Stay on task with a patch.  If you notice other problems while you are 
    working on a patch, and they are not most definitely specific to your patch, 
    they should be another patch.  The same goes for nitpicking.  While it might 
    be only a line or two here and there that is off track, this is actually one 
    of the easiest ways to make a patch difficult to review.  All the trivial 
    changes hide what is really going on.  Make the unrelated changes a new 
    patch or don't make them at all.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    If your patch addresses a strange issue or a rare edge case that the 
    reviewers are unlikely to be familiar with, make sure the commit message 
    include some example testcase with results, so the reviewers can verify 
    your patch more quickly.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Before you email, export.  If you have a patch called "alloc_fixes", which 
    would be emailed with "hg email alloc_fixes", you should first run "hg export 
    alloc_fixes".  This lets you review your patch.  Does it have any typos in 
    the comments?  Did you accidentally include an irrelevant change?  Is your 
    commit message still accurate and useful? This is the single biggest step in 
    ensuring you have a good patch.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    If your patch needs to be reworked and resent, prepend a "version number" to 
    the first line of the commit message.  For example, "Add EnumInstance to 
    RASD," becomes "#2 Add EnumInstance to RASD."  This helps mail readers thread 
    discussions correctly and helps maintainers know they are applying the right 
    version of your patch.  At the end of the commit message, explain what is 
    different from one version to the next.  Nobody likes having to diff a diff.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    If your patch depends on a patch that exists on the mailing list but not in 
    the tree, it is okay to send your patch to the list as long as your commit 
    message mentions the dependency.  It is also a good idea to import the 
    patch into your tree before you make your patch.  For example, a new patch 
    called "cu_statusf API change" is on the list, and your patch needs the new 
    API.  Save the email (no need to trim headers) as api_change.eml, then do 
    "hg qimport api_change.eml" and "hg qpush" so that the patch is applied to 
    your tree.  Now write your patch on top of it.  You should still indicate 
    the dependency in your commit message.
</p></li>
</ol><h4>Patchsets:</h4><ol><li>
  <p>
    When you send a group of patches, Mercurial's email extension will create a 
    "header" email.  Make the subject and body of that email meaningful, so we 
    know how the patches relate.  It's easy to say, "Each patch has a commit 
    message, it's obvious how they work together," but the rest of the list 
    usually won't agree with that.  If the commit messages for each patch are 
    good, you shouldn't need more than a sentence or two to tie them all 
    together, but you do need it.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    If any of your patches are rejected and you rework them, resend the entire 
    set.  This prevents things like, "So use patch 1 of 4 from the set I sent 
    yesterday, 2 and 3 of 4 from the patch I sent an hour later, and patch 4 
    of 4 from today."
  </p>
</li> 
<li>
  <p>
    If you resend a patchset, apply part (6) of the Single Patches guidelines to 
    your "Patch [0 of 3]" header email, for all the same reasons.
  </p>
